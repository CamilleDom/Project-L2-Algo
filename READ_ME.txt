Welcome to DIARY MANAGEMENT L2 Algorithmic Project

Link to git with the project : https://github.com/CamilleDom/Project-L2-Algo.git

To be able to run this program please first make sure to have all files
you're supposed to have 14 files:
- CMakeLists.txt
- main.c ( contain main program)
- Display.c & Display.h (display features and functions)
- fichier.c & fichier.h (functions of part 1&2)
- Fonction.c & Fonction.h (functions of part 3)
- timer.c & timer.h (timer module)
- f.txt (file with all the name for the contacts)
- Classic.txt ( file with the value of the classic search for the complexity)
- Level.txt (file with the value of the level search for the complexity)
- READ_ME.txt (where you are actually :3)

to be able to fully run this program you will need to
change in the program the paths of the files used during the program's running.

you have 5 paths to change :

1/ in Display.c, inside the function "void ContactFileToList(t_d_list_level* list)"
 in the second line of the function you need to change "C:\Users\camil\CLionProjects\final\f.txt"
 by the absolute path of the file "f.txt" in your computer.

2/ in Display.c, inside the function "void Test_time(t_d_list_level* list)"
   in the second line of the function you need to change "C:\Users\camil\CLionProjects\final\Classic.txt"
   by the absolute path of the file "Classic.txt" in your computer.

3/ in Display.c, inside the function "void Test_time(t_d_list_level* list)"
   in the third line of the function you need to change "C:\\Users\\camil\\CLionProjects\\final\\Level.txt"
   by the absolute path of the file "Level.txt" in your computer.

4/ in Display.c, inside the function "void Test_time(t_d_list_level* list)"
   in the sixth line of the function you need to change "C:\\Users\\camil\\CLionProjects\\final\\f.txt"
   by the absolute path of the file "f.txt" in your computer.

5/ in Display.c, inside the function "void Test_time(t_d_list_level* list)"
   in the twenty-sixth line of the function you need to change "C:\\Users\\camil\\CLionProjects\\final\\f.txt"
   by the absolute path of the file "f.txt" in your computer.

Once every paths are changed you can enjoy the program
To be sure that everything go as well as possible please follow each commands about the user intput.
